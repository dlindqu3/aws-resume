## The Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS - Frontend 
- The website [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/aws/) describes a sample AWS cloud project that involves hosting a resume copy on AWS 
- The frontend of the project is built with tools like S3, CloudFront, AWS Certificate Manager, HTML, and JavaScript
- My iteration of the project will follow similar guidelines, but will add other services / capabilities as I see fit
