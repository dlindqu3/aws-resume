## The Cloud Resume Challenge - AWS

- The website "Cloud Resume Challenge" describes a sample AWS cloud project that involves hosting a resume copy on AWS 
- The project is built with tools like AWS S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and AWS Severless Application Model (SAM) templates
- My iteration of the project will follow similar guidelines, but will add other services / capabilities as I see fit 

### Steps 
1. Set up an AWS Budget for $25 per month 
  - Set up  an AWS Budget alarm to notify me by email if a monthly cost hits 80% of that total  
  - Set up  an AWS Budget alarm to stop all services if a monthly cost hits that total
